<h1>The Book Shelf</h1>

<p>
The <strong>Book Shelf</strong> is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to simplify personal book management for readers and students. 
It allows users to search for books, add them to favorites, mark them as read or unread, and organize them into personalized collections.
</p>

<p>
In simple terms, it’s a personal book tracker where users can manage their reading journey — track which books they have read, which they plan to read, mark favorites, write reviews, and search for books using the Google Books API. 
(Reading full books inside the app is not supported.)
